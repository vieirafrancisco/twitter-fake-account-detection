# Twitter Fake Account Recognition
## Description:
The repo's main idea is to study the state-of-the-art about fake accounts in online social networks (OSNs), in special Twitter, bring new perspectives about the theme and create new solutions for the literature and for the community.

## Reasearch
The research, at the moment, only me are working with it as a student in the [Laboratoria de InteligÃªncia Computacional Aplicada (LICA)](https://github.com/LICA-UFAL) at Univerdade Federal de Alagoas with help from my lab's team mates.

## Sugestions
I'll try to bring most of the content of the research in this repo, any suggestion will be good received.
